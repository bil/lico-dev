LiCoRICE Examples

This directory contains working models that highlight LiCoRICE's capabilities. Please follow `instructions for installing LiCoRICE <https://docs.licorice.su.domains/install/licorice.html>`_ as a prerequisite to running any of the example models.

Example models
===============================================================================

To use these examples, simply run ``./examples/<example_name>/run.sh`` from the licorice repository root directory. Setting of the correct ``LICORICE_*`` environment variables is handled by the run scripts, so please take a look at how those work if you're curious.

For more information, please check out the `example documentation <https://docs.licorice.su.domains/guide/examples.html>`_ online.
