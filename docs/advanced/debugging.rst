Debugging realtime applications can be challenging. Many of the bugs that arise while running realtime applications have to do with timing and are a result of race conditions.

When debugging a LiCoRICE application, make sure to look at the files created in the model output directory. These are the rendered templates and the actual files compiled to run the application and are often much easier to debug than the core LiCoRICE code itself.

If you have ideas about how debugging LiCoRICE can be made easier, please post an issue and consider contributing!
